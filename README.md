🐍 Python Architecture & Standards Reference
A technical laboratory for documenting high-concurrency patterns, clean code standards, and idiomatic Python performance.

🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as a centralized reference for advanced Pythonic engineering. It documents my refined standards for system design, ensuring that even the most complex implementations remain maintainable, scalable, and idiomatic.

🏗️ Technical Pillars
Design Patterns: Implementation of GoF and SOLID principles tailored for Python’s dynamic nature.

Performance Optimization: Comparative analysis of data structures (e.g., Set vs. List) and memory-efficient generators.

Modern Standards: Leveraging dataclasses, enums, and Type Hinting to eliminate technical debt.

Robust IO: Context managers and EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission) patterns for resilient resource handling.

📂 Laboratory Structure
/design_patterns: Strategic implementations of Strategy, Observer, and Factory patterns.

/concurrency: Deep dives into asyncio and multi-threading for I/O-bound tasks.

/advanced_idioms: Best-practice examples of decorators, context managers, and advanced dunder methods.

/algorithms: Analysis of Big O complexity for core data manipulation tasks.

🛠️ Usage
Each module contains a standalone implementation and a README.md explaining the architectural "Why" behind the chosen pattern.
